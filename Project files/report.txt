CS3157 Project -- BRO-dway

In order to execute the website run the main.pl.cgi script.

Division of labor.

Ryder's Work:
	Ryder set up the framework of the website, created methods such as render() to allow html files to be called and rendered, with variables passed into the views. Ryder also handled 
	most of the frontend work. most of the methods that take input from the user where written by ryder. We are using Twitter Bootstrap for the styling of the website since it speeds up development considerably. 

Enrique's Work:
	Enrique wrote most of the interaction with the "database", which is a series of txt files. He wrote the methods to retrieve and modify information within them and parse it in such way that it can be used by the front
	end methoods. He also set up the pdf rendering so that users can view all of the tickets they have 
	purchased. 
	
All of the remaining work was split between both of us as we saw fit while writing the code, dividing work was not an issua since the project in almost it's entirety was coded by both of
simultaniously and using a github account..

NOTE: For the PDF generation we relied on a module take from CPan and adapted it to be used by our project.
